**On Hsien Chun (3/n)**

**Tatsuda Noboru**

Although a specific Hsien Chung loses one less time because he is not scrutinized with a magnifying glass to see if he is the “perfect victim”, however, the name “Hsien Chung” is still sometimes exploited by the authorities - which is one of the manifestations of the extreme inequality of power between the rulers and the ruled in today's China：the authorities shamelessly use almost everything.

On September 18th of this year, in Shenzhen, a Chinese man stabbed to death a Japanese child attending a Japanese school in Shenzhen. A Kyodo News reporter asked a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry what she thought of the characterization of the case as an “incidental and isolated case”， and the spokesman said there was “a basis” for the characterization.

By recognizing the “incidental and isolated case”, the authorities are trying to avoid accusations that they have incited - or at least allowed - ethnic antagonism between China and Japan in its own country. At this point, the authorities would rather recognize the existence of Hsien Chung than admit that the rising nationalist hatred against Japan in the country gave birth to a perpetrator who targeted Japanese people. This is how the name “Hsien Chung” was utilized.

If there was a press spokesman at the Qing government's prime minister's office, then An Shigeki's assassination of Ito Hirobumi would have been an “incidental and isolated case” - which reminds us of the joke that Napoleon said, “If I had Pravda! ......” Now, the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry has been added to Napoleon's wish list.

But the connection between the so-called “incidental and isolated case” and the Hsien Chung we are talking about is really worth exploring. In China, there is a simple belief that there is always a certain percentage of violent crime in society. For this reason, there is also a rate of violent acts, specifically indiscriminate killings.

This simple view was originally derived from the first three pages of the so-called “Marxist conception of crime” - only the first three pages were within the patience of the people who read them - where one reads: “Durkheim argued that crime exists in all societies, while Marx argued that it is peculiar to class society.” Well, that's all there is to read - one closes the book. After all, both Durkheim and Marx recognized the existence of crime in class society, and one thinks it is enough to remember that.

The idea that “criminal behavior exists in class society” is, today, combined with a simple eugenic belief, and so the idea goes to form: “In society there is always a certain percentage of people who hold the 'criminal gene'.”

Perhaps because of the long-standing influence of the basic national policy of “family planning,” the people's simple eugenic beliefs play a role in almost every issue. For example, the Chinese believe that “about 4% of the population has the ‘gay gene’.” As a result, the Chinese accept the existence of homosexuals in China at such a small percentage of the population; in other words, they “pardon” only such homosexuals. At the same time, there is opposition to the political expression of sexual minorities for fear that these voices will “teach children” and “create more homosexuals.” People who display this conservative stance do not realize that the current homosexual population in society does not match the 4% of the population that is believed to carry the “gay gene.” Many of those who do in fact carry the gene do not become living homosexuals, and living homosexuals do not necessarily carry that particular gene.

The same is true with regard to the issue of “Hsien Chung”. It is considered inevitable that there will be a certain percentage of “natural” violent offenders in the general population. In other words, “Hsien Chung” is bound to occur regardless of the social system in a class society. The crimes committed by Hsien Chung are in this sense considered to be “incidental and isolated case”.

The purpose of declaring Hsien Chung's crimes as “incidental and isolated cases” is to emphasize the “innocence” of the social system. In this sense, however, one departs from Marx's doctrine and comes to terms with Durkheim's instead. It was Durkheim who argued that a certain proportion of crime exists in any society, i.e., Durkheim provided a non-zero “initial value” of the crime rate for every society. Marx, on the other hand, argued that the “initial value” of the crime rate is zero: in primitive and communist societies there is no crime, and it is only in class societies that specific social systems structurally generate their particular crime rates.

However, neither Durkheim nor Marx can adequately defend China's social system today. Suicide and Hsien Chung rates in China today exceed the “initial values” that Durkheim assumed to be the lower bounds, and thus the phenomena of suicide and Hsien Chung in China have yet to receive their sociological attribution. Therefore, the phenomena of suicide and “loyalty” in China have yet to receive their sociological attribution. The phenomenon of Hsien Chung is not something that can be brushed aside and pretended to be a peaceful world with a flippant remark of “an incidental and isolated case”. Even if Durkheim were to come back to life, he would still have to study the phenomenon of Hsien Chung in Chinese society. And if Marx were to come back to life - as the Chinese are already doing on TV programs today - the scene would be so dramatic that it would go beyond the limits of enjoyment.

**论献忠（其三）**

**辰田昇**

尽管具体的“献忠”，以其没有被“开棺验尸”——以一种放大镜审视他是否是“完美受害者”——因而少输一次；然而，“献忠”这一名目，有时仍然会被当局加以利用——这正是的今天的中国统治者与被统治者之间实力极端不对等的体现之一：当局无耻地利用几乎一切。

今年9月18日，在深圳，一个中国人刺死了一名在深圳日本人学校就读的日本儿童。共同社记者问中国外交部的新闻发言人，如何看待把这起案件说成是“偶发个案”的看法，发言人说这种说法“有其依据”。

当局认可“偶发个案”的说法，是为了回避关于其在国内煽动——至少也是放任，中日民族对立情绪的有关指控。此时，当局宁可承认“献忠”的存在，也不愿意承认是国内高涨的指向日本的民族主义仇恨情绪催生了一名针对日本人下手的现行犯。这就是“献忠”这一名目被利用的情况。

如果清政府的总理衙门有新闻发言人，那么安重根刺杀伊藤博文也是一起“偶发个案”——这让我们想起一个笑话：拿破仑说，“如果我有《真理报》的话……”现在，中国外交部的新闻发言人也加入了拿破仑的愿望单。

不过，所谓的“偶发个案”与我们所谈论的“献忠”之间的联系确实值得探讨。在中国，人们持有一种朴素的看法，即社会中始终存在一定比率的暴力犯罪。基于此，具体到无差别杀人的暴力行为，也有其比率。

这一朴素看法最初是从所谓“马克思主义犯罪观”的专题内容的前三页中得来的——对于这些枯燥的专题内容，人们几乎只读的进去三页，于是，人们看到：“涂尔干认为一切社会都存在着犯罪现象，而马克思认为犯罪现象是阶级社会所特有的。”好了，就读到这里——人们合上了书本。毕竟，无论是涂尔干还是马克思，都承认阶级社会中存在犯罪，人们认为记住这一点就够了。

“阶级社会存在犯罪行为”的观念，在今天，与一种朴素的优生学观念结合起来了，于是，这个观念走形成了：“在社会中，总有一定的比例人持有‘罪犯的基因’。”

也许是因为长期遭受“计划生育”的基本国策的影响，人们的朴素的优生学观念几乎在每一个议题上都发挥着作用。比如，中国人相信“人口中约有4%的人口拥有‘同性恋基因’。”因此，人们也就只接受那么些比例的同性恋者在中国存在，换句话说，人们仅仅“赦免”这么些同性恋者。与此同时，人们反对性少数群体政治表达，因为担心这些发声会“教坏小孩子”“制造更多同性恋者”。表现出这种保守主义姿态的人们丝毫没有意识到，目前社会中的同性恋人群与被认为携带“同性恋基因”的4%人口并不匹配。许多事实上携带这一基因的人并没有成为生活中的同性恋者，而生活中的同性恋者未必携带这一特定基因。

在“献忠”的议题上亦然（情况也是如此）。人们认为总人口中不可避免地会有一定比例的“天然的”暴力犯罪者。换句话说，无论在阶级社会中的哪种社会制度下，“献忠”一定会出现。“献忠”所犯下的罪行在这个意义上被认为是“偶发个案”。

宣布“献忠”的罪行是“偶发个案”，旨在强调社会制度的“无辜”。然而，在这个意义上，人们偏离了马克思（的学说），反而与涂尔干（的学说）走到了一起。是涂尔干认为任何社会中都存在一定比例的犯罪，也就是说，涂尔干为每个社会都提供了一个非零值的犯罪率“初始值”。而马克思则认为犯罪率“初始值”就是零：在原始社会和共产主义社会中不存在犯罪，只有在阶级社会中，具体的社会制度才结构性地生成其特定的犯罪率。

然而，无论是涂尔干还是马克思，今天都不足以为中国的社会制度做辩护。今天中国的自杀率和“献忠”率，超出了涂尔干所假定的作为下限的“初始值”，因此，中国的自杀现象和“献忠”现象是有待得到其社会学归因（sciological imputation）的。献忠现象，不是谁轻飘飘的一句“偶发个案”就可以搁置一旁，装作天下太平的。即使是涂尔干复生，他也要研究研究（中国社会的“献忠”现象）。而如果马克思复生——正如今天的中国人已经在电视节目中演绎的那样——那画面太美，我不敢看。

**On Hsien Chung（1 of n）**

**Tatsuda noboru**

Hsien Chung has been established as a reference to a random murderer in the “revenge society” style, mainly because it is rumored that Zhang Xianzhong erected a “monument of seven killings” and wrote a “poem of seven killings”. “and wrote a poem about the seven killings. “Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!” is a very eloquent phrase, and today the only means that can serve as an effective resistance is to “kill x 7” - a phrase from the Report on the Examination of the Peasant Movement in Hunan that people today like to invoke when they are engaged in struggles in many subcultural areas: “Corrective action must go too far.” However, in the matter of struggle in public social life, it is as if people have forgotten this saying, but only here, where the struggle is most necessary: since society chronically kills me as a member of society, the means by which I am corrected too rightly should be the acute killing of many members of this society. This is appropriate.

Today, I am going to write this article to do justice to Hsien Chung.

In a broad sense, the logic of righting Hsien Chung is the same as the logic of righting Hamas. @BostonMoonface In a video from October 18, 2024, he says: “When there is an extreme disparity of power between the two sides, it is essentially impossible to expect one side to express resistance in what is known as a ‘modern and precise way.’”

Nowadays, there are many young people in China who canonize Yahya Sinwar, but very few are willing to recognize the value of Hsien Chung as an example of resistance, probably because it is really possible to “Hsien Chung” him, and as long as there is a wedge in the heart of the Middle East like Israel as a target, the “jihad” of the West Asian religious elements is not going to be a success. The “Jihad” of the West Asian religious elements will not be waged against him in his lifetime.

The one who assigns a priori significance to a position does not care about accusations of “double standards”, because he chooses the standard that is favorable according to his position. We, too, are “double standard” in that we reject Hamas because of its fundamental Islamic beliefs, but we stand up for Hsien Chung because of this reasoning that others use to defend Hamas, as presented by @BostonMoonface. If someone says, “I can't accept this line of rhetoric about the extremely weak side taking an ‘imprecise’ approach to resistance, I'm willing to condemn Hamas and Hsien Chung equally.” Does that change our attitudes? Not really, it's just a nononsense. while we talk about Hamas, the question is clearly not how to evaluate Hamas, but still how to look at Hsien Chung, and ultimately, it's a matter of finding a way out of the general problem of our public social life.

**论献忠（其一）**

**辰田昇**

“献忠”（Hsien Chung）被确立为“报复社会”式的随机杀人的凶手的指代，主要是因为相传张献忠立过一个“七杀碑”，写过一首“七杀诗”。“杀、杀、杀、杀、杀、杀、杀！”是非常雄辩的一句话，在今天，只有“杀×7”这种手段，能够作为一种有效的抵抗——今天的人们在许多亚文化领域开展斗争的时候，喜欢援引《湖南农民运动考察报告》中的一句话:“矫枉必须过正。”然而，在公共社会生活的斗争问题上，人们却仿佛忘记了这句话，却唯独，在这里的斗争是最需要讲这句话的：既然社会慢性地杀死作为社会一分子的我，那么，我过正地矫枉的手段，就应该是急性杀死这个社会的许多分子。这是恰如其分的。

今天，我要写下这篇文章，为献忠正名。

从广义上讲，为献忠正名的逻辑，和为哈马斯正名的逻辑，是一致的。@波士顿圆脸 在2024年10月18日的视频中说：“当两边实力极端不对等的时候，希望一方以所谓的‘现代的精准的方式来表达反抗’是基本上不可能的。”

现在，在中国，给叶海亚·辛瓦尔封圣的青年人很多，但是，愿意承认献忠作为一种抵抗手段的榜样价值的人很少，可能是因为献忠真的有可能“献”到他，而只要有以色列这么一个插入中东腹地的楔子作为靶子，西亚宗教分子的“圣战”在他的有生之年发动不到他的身上。

“立场先行”（赋予立场以先决意义）的人并不会在意关于他“双标”的指责，因为他就是根据自己的立场，选择有利的标准。我们也是“双标”的，我们因为哈马斯的原教旨的伊斯兰信仰而否定哈马斯，却因为波士顿圆脸所介绍的如许的别人用来为哈马斯辩护的这条理由，而为献忠站台。如果有人说：“我不能接受实力极端虚弱的一方采取‘不精准’的方式反抗的这套说辞，我愿意同等地谴责哈马斯和献忠。”这能让我们改变态度吗？并不能，这只是一种nonsense。尽管我们谈论到了哈马斯，但是问题显然不是如何评价哈马斯，而还是如何看待献忠的问题，归根到底，是为我们的公共社会生活的总问题找到出路的事。

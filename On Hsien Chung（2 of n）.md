**On Hsien Chung（2 of n）**

**Tatsuda Noboru**

There is a historical phenomenon called “adding insult to injury”. Almost all non-“Hsien Chung” murderers - themselves structurally victimized by society as a whole - experience this second moment of humiliation.

The Hsien Chung murderers, however, are almost never subjected to this humiliation. This may be due to the term Hsien Chung itself, as well as the phenomenon of Hsien Chung-“revenge on society” style random killings- are themselves already ‘insulted’ in advance.

Isn't that so? Let us not forget the etymology of the word Hsien Chung, for the “massacre of Sichuan by Zhang Xianzhong” was originally a myth created by the rulers of the Qing Dynasty. In the Ming History edited by Zhang Tingyu, Zhang Xianzhong 's generals and soldiers “killed 60,000,000 men and women”. Zhang Xianzhong certainly killed many Sichuanese, however, during the same era, the Qing army killed many more people overall during their entry into the country. In the end, the Qing Dynasty put the blame for the depopulation of the Sichuan area on Hsien Chung's head.

When people blame Hsien Chung for killing a limited number of “innocent” people in a specific public space, they forget that the “Qing army” systematically persecuted people throughout China. The Public Security Bureau (PSB) rarely issues alerts on suicide cases. Only in May of this year in Taiyuan, where there were reportedly “a dozen consecutive jumps” (more than a dozen suicides by jumping into the river) in less than half a month, can the cases be treated as a kind of “urban legend” that is slightly publicized by people with a little bit of “Internet scale” memory.

Therefore, when one reads the news about the case of Hsien Chung again, one should think that this is only one suicide among hundreds of them who finally appeared to “looking for a body mattress”- according to a certain “natural” probability. Therefore, the issue of Hsien Chung is in fact a subissue of the issue of social suicide rate.

Turning back to the “adding insult to injury” of non-Hsien Chung murderers, in late September a man in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, killed a Grid management commissioner. The media told the public that he was found to have deposits, and then canceled the treatment of low-income households, so he killed in anger. Then some people said that the murderer had “killed the wrong person”, and that he should have killed the person who had made the decision to cancel his low-income household entitlement, instead of killing the Grid management commissioner who had found out that he had deposits. This kind of accusation is “adding insult to injury”. If you ask me, in the sense of killing the wrong person or the right person, he would have to kill 50 people to make it count. Because the intensity of competition in the civil service examination in Jiangsu Province is on average fifty people competing for a post, that is to say, “kill the right person” so what? There are fifty candidates for this position - according to a joke, the registration fee paid by these candidates is already enough to pay the salary of the person in this position for a long time.

In the Hsien Chung case, by contrast, there has been little questioning of the specific image of individual Hsien Chung, of his suffering, and therefore no way to make such comments, which are in fact humiliating. For example, in the Hsien Chung case in Dongping County, Tai'an City, Shandong Province, in early September, the history of Hsien Chung's suffering was not disclosed. If “adding insult to injury” is a case of “losing twice”, then Hsien Chung lost one less time in this fight. That's why I say that Hsien Chung was an effective resistance, or rather, a real resistance - people today don't like the word “real” for their philosophical point of view! --Because people do not look at Hsien Chung with the magnifying glass of the “perfect victim”.

**论献忠（其二）**

**辰田昇**

有一种历史现象叫做“Add insult to injury”，就是说“受害复被辱”。几乎所有非“献忠”的凶杀案的凶手——他们本身是整个社会中的结构性的受害者——都会经受这种第二时刻到来的侮辱。

然而，“献忠”案的凶手却几乎很少受到这种侮辱。这可能是因为“献忠”这个名词本身，以及“献忠”这种现象——“报复社会”式的随机杀人——本身，已经预先“受过辱了”。

难道不是吗？不要忘了“献忠”这个词的语源，“张献忠屠蜀”本来就是清朝统治者制造的神话。在张廷玉主编的《明史》中，张献忠的将、卒（将领和士兵）“共杀男女六万万有奇”。张献忠当然杀死了许多四川人，然而，在同一时代，清军在入关的过程中，总体上杀死了更多的人。最终，四川地区的人口锐减的这笔账，被清朝总体地算到了张献忠的头上。

当人们指责“献忠”们在具体的公共空间杀掉了有限的几个“无辜”的人，人们忘了，“清军”在全中国系统性迫害着人民。公安局很少就自杀案件发出警情通报。只有像今年5月份的太原，在不到半个月的时间里据说发生了“十几连跳”（十几起跳河自杀案），它们才能被作为一种“都市传说”被人们稍微以“互联网尺度下的”记忆力被记住。

因此，再看到“献忠”案件的新闻时，人们应该想到，这只是几百个自杀者中按照某种“自然”的概率终于出现了的一个“找垫背的”的自杀者。因此，“献忠”议题其实是社会自杀率议题的子议题。

回过头来，让我们谈谈非“献忠”案的凶手“受害复被辱”的情况。9月末，江苏省南通市一男子杀死了一名网格员。媒体告诉公众说，他被排查出有存款，进而被取消了低保户待遇，因故愤而杀人。于是有人说，凶手“杀错了人”，他应该去杀作出取消他低保户待遇决策的人，而不是杀排查出他有存款的网格员。这种指责，就是“adding insult to injury”。要我说，在杀错杀对的意义上，他要杀五十个人才够数。因为江苏省公务员考试的竞争烈度平均是五十个人竞争一个岗位，也就是说，“杀对了一个人”又如何呢？这个岗位有五十个候补者——按照一个笑话所说的那样，这些候补者所缴的考试报名费已经足够支付这个岗位上的人领很久的工资。

相反，在献忠案中，人们却很少过问个别献忠的具体形象，过问他的苦难，因此也就无从发表这种事实上是一种羞辱的评论。比如，9月初的山东省泰安市东平县的献忠案，这位献忠的苦难史就没有被披露。如果说“adding insult to injury”是“输两次”的情况，那么，献忠在这场斗争中少输一次。这就是为什么我说“献忠”是一种有效的抵抗，或者说，真正的抵抗——今天的人们就其哲学观点而言不喜欢“真正的”这样的词——因为，人们不以“完美受害者”的放大镜来对献忠进行开棺验尸式的观察。
